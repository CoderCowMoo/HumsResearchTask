                <h1>History</h1>
                Ever since the settling of homo sapiens from hunting and gathering into agriculture, there was a need for calculations and data management. This first came in the form of the abacus, first used in 2300-2700 BC, which allowed quick addition and subtraction of numbers. Mechanical devices to assist in calculations stagnated in exception of some who created more complex abacuses.<br><br>

                The use of computers in WWII increased dramatically due to the need for faster computations and encryption. The most essential use was the calculations of the Manhattan Project on the ENIAC computer which was originally created for the Ballistics Research Laboratory of the US Army, but diverted for the Manhattan Project. The development of this computer was a significant enough change of speed of calculations that one ENIAC computer could displace approximately 2400 humans.<br><br>  
                <h1>Effect</h1>
                This had an immediate impact on the development of the nuclear bomb as John von Neumann compared the effectiveness of an implosion type fission or gun-type fission and allowed the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare to be dropped on Hiroshima, killing more than 80,000 people in the first blast and many more to come. Many question the ethics of the bomb, but ignore the tools that created it because tools alone are neither ethical or unethical, evil or good, but merely tools for creation.<br><br>
                
                After the surrender of the Japanese, WWII ended and the Allies could begin rebuilding their nations, but because of America's thriving economy, it was able to go ahead on the building of more advanced computers for the military and commercially. With the first large leap being the Xerox Alto which was created in 1973 and which provided a baseline for personal computers to come, inspiring early Apple and IBM designs for personal computers.<br><br>
                
                The impact of powerful processing is still felt today, as many people are able to use devices that can fit into their palm but have more processing power than all computers before the 1990s. Today, computers are used in all sorts of fields from science to finance, because of their amazing speed in doing calculations and are absolutely irreplaceable, regardless of any new technologies, due to the wide range of functions of the computer.<br><br>
                
                The scope of the computer is such that all other fields presently depend on it, for example, military vehicles from fighter jets to automatic weapons require computers to be made and function, in the field of medicine, computers and processors display the current status of the patient and manage hundreds of thousands of patients in databases. Emergency call services depend on the processing power of computers to manage, distribute and pinpoint calls.<br><br>

                Many argue that the invention of computers saved many lives because of the early end to the war, the increased capacity of emergency services and the quicker communication between people. To the right, a graph displaying the processing power of computers through time, beginning in the 1900's and ending in the 2000's. It can be seen that the processing power is increasing linearly with almost double the processing power each two years. This is called Moore's law.
